# React Native Api Calls

This is a tutorial on making API calls using the Axios library in an Expo React Native app. We'll cover everything from installation to sending requests and handling responses.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following:

- An Expo React Native project set up and running.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React Native.
- Installing Axios

To install Axios, open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then run the following command:


- npm install axios

This will install Axios and add it as a dependency to your project.

## Importing Axios

Once Axios is installed, you can import it into your project. In the file where you want to use Axios, add the following import statement:

javascript

- import axios from 'axios';
